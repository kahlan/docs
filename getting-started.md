### Installation
The recommended way to install Kahlan is with [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) as a *development* dependency of your project.

```bash
composer require --dev kahlan/kahlan
```

Alternatively, you may manually add `"kahlan/kahlan": "~3.0"` to the `require-dev` dependencies within your `composer.json`.

If you wish the executable `kahlan` live in your root `bin` directory, you can setup composer config:

```bash
composer config bin-dir bin
```

## Running Kahlan
Once Kahlan is installed, you can run your tests (referred to as *specs*) with:

```bash
./bin/kahlan
```

For a full list of the options, see the [CLI Options](cli-options.md).

### Directory Structure
The recommended directory structure is to add a `spec` directory at the top level of your project. You may then place your *Spec* files within this directory. Spec files should have a `.spec.php` or `Spec.php` suffix. The `spec` directory should mirror the structure of your source code directory.

An example directory structure would be:

```
├── spec                       # The directory containing your specs
│   └── ClassA.spec.php
│   └── subdir
│       └── ClassB.spec.php
├── src                        # The directory containing your source code
│   └── ClassA.php
│   └── subdir
│       └── ClassB.php
├── composer.json
└── README.md
```
