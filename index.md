> The PHP Test Framework for Freedom, Truth, and Justice

Kahlan is a full-featured Unit & BDD test framework a la RSpec/JSpec which uses a `describe-it` syntax and moves testing in PHP one step forward.

**Kahlan allows to stub or monkey patch your code directly like in Ruby or JavaScript without any required PECL-extentions.**


<a name="features"></a>
### Features
- `describe-it` syntax similar to modern BDD testing frameworks
- Code Coverage metrics ([xdebug](http://xdebug.org) or [phpdbg](http://phpdbg.com/docs) required)
- Handy stubbing system ([mockery](https://github.com/padraic/mockery) or [prophecy](https://github.com/phpspec/prophecy) are no longer needed)
- Set stubs on your class methods directly (i.e allows dynamic mocking)
- Ability to Monkey Patch your code (i.e. allows replacement of core functions/classes on the fly)
- Check called methods on your classes/instances
- Built-in Reporters (Terminal or HTML reporting through [istanbul](https://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/) or [lcov](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php))
- Built-in Exporters (Coveralls, Code Climate, Scrutinizer, Clover)
- Extensible, customizable workflow
